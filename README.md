# Monero-with-pi-Zero-w-2
 
Showing all my findings on Mining Monero on a raspbery pi zero w and how I did it.

Recently I have found myself very intrested in crypto currency, mostly on Monero (XMR) Crypto currency, mostly to learn on how crypto currency works and how mining and all that stuffs play into it, so I figured that if I can figure out how to mine on a raspberry pi zero for educational purposes can teach me and others who also find this intresting. I will make it very easy to understand and also create a videos on my findings on my Youtube channel, And once I get my website done I will post a guid there also to get started.

This is a few things needed for this project.

- Raspberry pi zero w 2 ( $15 )
- Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter ( $5 )
- Micro SD card 16gb or more ( $5 - 10 )
- Micro USB to female USB ( $5 - 15 )
- A PC or Mac to access files

As of currently the method that I am using I could not get SHH working at first so a capturecard or a tv/monitor will work just for the set up process in the beggining of this project ( it wont be needed later on ).
