# Monero with pi Zero 2w
 
Showing all my findings on Mining Monero on a raspbery pi zero w and how I did it.

Recently I have found myself very intrested in crypto currency, mostly on Monero (XMR) Crypto currency, mostly to learn on how crypto currency works and how mining and all that stuffs play into it, so I figured that if I can figure out how to mine on a raspberry pi zero for educational purposes can teach me and others who also find this intresting. I will make it very easy to understand and also create a videos on my findings on my Youtube channel, And once I get my website done I will post a guid there also to get started.

## This is a few things needed for this project:
- Raspberry pi zero w 2 ( $15 ) 
[MakeBright](https://makerbright.com/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-.html), [ChicagoDeals](https://chicagodist.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2?variant=39620996923471), [Pishop](https://www.pishop.us/product/raberry-pi-zero-2-w/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5291), [Micro_Center](https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=Raspberry+Pi+Zero+2+W), [Last_Resort](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LH5SBPS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_AJ5ZC8AASWMYPV4DDD1F)

- Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter ( $5 )

- Micro SD card 32gb or more ( $5 - 10 )
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K81Z6DF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_3DJ9AZDCQW52NWA4YNZC)

- Micro USB to female USB ( $5 - 15 )
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N9S9Z0G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_HJVME91D0SS6RBCV1Y5P?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

- A PC or Mac to access files ( I will leave a link to how to do this on iphone and android )

As of currently the method that I am using I could not get SHH working at first so a capturecard or a tv/monitor will work just for the set up process in the beggining of this project ( it wont be needed later on ).

## Extra Things to get

The way I did all this was throught a cheap chinese capturecard that I found in that drawer full of random forgotten and random crap that some of us have. I used it to well its in the name so I dont really gotta explain more than that so here is the link where i got it if you dont want to unplug your hdmi from your monitor or tv: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L19KCFJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_YVSB0SZ94A8NMFDGDWBV).

You will need OBS or some type of recorder, when you connect the capturecard it will show up as a camera source so just add that and connect the micro HDMI to the pi and get a HDMI cable and connect it and it shoudl show up once we install the os and do everything else, I will show how i did it so dont worry.

## A little note

I am also currently working on finding a method to do it on a regular pi zero w and ofc all of this is for learning perposes!

TAKING A BREAK FROM THIS PROJECT I JUST MOVED LEAVE ME ALONE
